// dataAggregator.ts
//
// This utility module is responsible for aggregating data from various sources to generate comprehensive reports.
// It is used by the reporting and analytics service to process raw data into structured formats suitable for analysis and visualization.
//
// Requirements Addressed:
// - Provide comprehensive reporting and analytical tools for tracking, managing, and forecasting expenses, tailored to different user roles.
//   (Technical Specification/13.6 Reporting and Analytics)
//
// The `aggregateData` function aggregates data to produce structured reports, fulfilling requirements:
// - TR-F006.2: Generate detailed expense reports by employee, department, project, or cost center.
// - TR-F006.3: Perform trend analysis for travel spending.
// - TR-F006.5: Provide tax liability reports for different jurisdictions.

// Importing external dependencies
// Importing mongoose for interacting with MongoDB (version ^5.10.9)
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

// Importing internal dependencies
import ReportModel from '../models/reportModel';
import reportService from '../services/reportService';
import analyticsService from '../services/analyticsService';
