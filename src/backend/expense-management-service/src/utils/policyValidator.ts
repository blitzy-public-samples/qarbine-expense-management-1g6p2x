// Utility module for validating expenses against company policies and international tax laws.
// This module ensures that all submitted expenses comply with predefined rules and regulations, providing real-time validation feedback.

// Requirements Addressed:
// - Policy and Compliance Engine (Technical Specification/13.3 Policy and Compliance Engine)
//   - TR-F003.1: Configure expense policies based on employee level, department, and travel destination
//   - TR-F003.2: Perform real-time policy checks during expense submission
//   - TR-F003.3: Integrate with global tax databases to maintain up-to-date tax laws
//   - TR-F003.5: Flag expenses that exceed policy limits or require additional approval

// Importing necessary models and utilities

// Importing Expense model to access and validate expense data
import { Expense } from '../models/expenseModel';

// Importing Receipt model to validate receipts associated with expenses
import { Receipt } from '../models/receiptModel';

// Importing convertCurrency utility to ensure expenses are validated with consistent currency values
import { convertCurrency } from './currencyConverter';
