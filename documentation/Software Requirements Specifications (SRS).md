### 6.2 Data Storage

#### Data Storage Architecture

The application utilizes a cloud-based storage solution to ensure scalability, reliability, and security. The primary components include:

- **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for transactional data such as user information, expense reports, and approval workflows.
- **Object Storage:** A secure object storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) for storing receipts, digital documents, and backups.

#### Data Retention

- **Expense Reports:** Retained for a minimum of seven years to comply with regulatory and tax requirements.
- **User Data:** Retained for the duration of employment and an additional five years post-employment.
- **Audit Logs:** Maintained indefinitely to support ongoing compliance and auditing needs.

#### Redundancy and Backup

- **Data Redundancy:** 
  - **Primary and Secondary Replicas:** Implement database replication across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
  - **Geographical Redundancy:** Store backups in geographically diverse locations to protect against regional outages.
- **Backup Strategies:**
  - **Automated Daily Backups:** Perform daily automated backups of the database with versioning to allow point-in-time recovery.
  - **Incremental Backups:** Utilize incremental backups throughout the day to minimize data loss in case of a failure.
  - **Snapshot Management:** Regular snapshots of object storage data to enable quick restoration of receipts and documents.

#### Recovery at Scale

- **Disaster Recovery Plan:** 
  - **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 4 hours for full system restoration.
  - **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 15 minutes to ensure minimal data loss.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Leverage cloud infrastructure that can scale horizontally to handle increased load during recovery processes.
- **Automated Failover:** Implement automated failover mechanisms to switch to backup systems seamlessly in the event of a primary system failure.

### 6.3 Data Processing

#### Data Security

- **Encryption:**
  - **Data in Transit:** All data transmitted between clients and servers is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
  - **Data at Rest:** Sensitive data stored in databases and object storage is encrypted using AES-256 standards.
- **Access Controls:**
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Enforce strict RBAC policies to ensure users can only access data pertinent to their roles.
  - **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant the minimum level of access required for users to perform their duties.
- **Data Anonymization:** Implement data anonymization techniques for reporting and analytics to protect user privacy where applicable.
