### 5. Component Interactions

- **User Interactions:**
  - Users access the application via web browsers or mobile devices. All client requests are routed through the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to ensure optimal resource distribution and high availability.

- **Authentication Flow:**
  - The Authentication Service manages user logins, leveraging OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0 for secure and seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) experiences. MFA is enforced to enhance security.

- **Expense Submission and Management:**
  - When a user submits an expense, the Expense Management Service processes the data, interacts with the Relational Database for storage, and utilizes OCR technology for receipt scanning. Real-time policy checks are performed to ensure compliance.

- **Approval Workflow:**
  - Submitted expenses are routed through the Approval Workflow Service, which manages multi-level approvals, batch processing, and delegation. Notifications are sent to managers for pending approvals.

- **Reimbursement Processing:**
  - Approved expenses are handled by the Reimbursement Processing Service, which integrates with Payroll Systems to automate direct deposits and manage multiple reimbursement methods.

- **Reporting and Analytics:**
  - The Reporting and Analytics Service aggregates data from the Relational Database and Object Storage to generate customizable dashboards and detailed reports for finance teams and executives.

- **External Integrations:**
  - The system interfaces with Accounting Systems, HR Systems, Payroll Systems, Tax Databases, and Currency Exchange Providers through secure RESTful APIs, ensuring data consistency and real-time updates.

- **Data Security:**
  - All data transmissions are encrypted using TLS 1.2+, and sensitive data at rest is secured with AES-256 encryption. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that users have appropriate access permissions based on their roles.

### 6. Scalability and Redundancy

- **Scalability:**
  - The system is designed with horizontal scalability in mind, allowing the addition of more EC2 instances behind the Elastic Load Balancer to handle increased load without impacting performance.

- **Redundancy:**
  - Critical components such as the Relational Database and Object Storage are replicated across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Automated backups and disaster recovery plans are in place to minimize downtime and data loss.

### 7. Security Considerations

- **Data Protection:**
  - Comprehensive encryption strategies (TLS 1.2+ for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest) are implemented to protect sensitive information.

- **Access Control:**
  - RBAC ensures that users can only access functionalities and data necessary for their roles. MFA adds an additional layer of security during authentication.

- **Compliance:**
  - The architecture adheres to international data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, with data localization and anonymization techniques applied where necessary.

#### API Design Considerations

- **Authentication and Authorization:** All endpoints, except for `/api/auth/login`, require authentication via JWT tokens. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized roles can access specific endpoints.

- **Input Validation:** All API inputs are validated to prevent malformed data and ensure data integrity. Errors are handled gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse and ensure fair usage of APIs.

- **Versioning:** APIs are versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/`) to facilitate backward compatibility and smooth transitions during updates.

- **Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation is provided using tools like Swagger or API Blueprint to aid developers in understanding and utilizing the APIs effectively.

- **Security Measures:** All data transmissions occur over HTTPS to ensure encryption in transit. Sensitive information is never exposed in API responses.

### Containerization

The application utilizes containerization to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments. Docker is employed for containerizing application components, providing the following benefits:

- **Isolation:** Encapsulates application services, dependencies, and configurations within containers, ensuring isolated and consistent runtime environments.
- **Portability:** Facilitates seamless movement of containers across different environments without compatibility issues.
- **Efficiency:** Enables efficient utilization of system resources by running multiple containers on a single host.
- **Scalability:** Simplifies the process of scaling application components horizontally by replicating containers as needed.

### Orchestration

Kubernetes is the chosen container orchestration tool for managing Docker containers in production. The use of Kubernetes is justified by the following factors:

- **Automated Deployment:** Streamlines the deployment process with automated rollouts and rollbacks.
- **Scaling:** Facilitates horizontal scaling of application services based on demand and predefined metrics.
- **Self-Healing:** Automatically replaces or restarts failed containers to maintain application availability.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Manages internal networking, allowing services to discover and communicate with each other efficiently.
- **Declarative Configuration:** Enables infrastructure as code, allowing for version-controlled and repeatable deployments.

#### Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Commit:** Developers push code changes to the GitHub repository.
2. **Continuous Integration:** GitHub Actions triggers the CI pipeline, building the application and running automated tests.
3. **Artifact Creation:** Upon successful tests, Docker images are created and pushed to Docker Hub or AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
4. **Continuous Deployment:** Jenkins or AWS CodeDeploy retrieves the Docker images and deploys them to the Kubernetes cluster.
5. **Deployment:** The Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment of containers across worker nodes, ensuring high availability and scalability.
6. **Monitoring:** CloudWatch and New Relic monitor application performance, triggering alerts and feedback loops for continuous improvement.
